Hello everyone, welcome to my GitHub repository for the Weather Website.

In order to start the website you need to follow these steps.

1 Download the entire project
2 - Go to a command prompt or Windows PowerShell (you need to run them as administrator)
3 Type these commands one at a time:
 - cd ...\WeatherProject
 - npm install
 - npm run build
 - npm run dev
4 After running the last command, look for the line starting with "Local:" in the terminal. Copy the full URL address you find there (for example, `http://localhost:XXXX/`, where `XXXX` is the port number) and paste it into your browser to access the website.
